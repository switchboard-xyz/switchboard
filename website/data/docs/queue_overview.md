An oracle queue is an independent realm of oracles, responsible for allocating
oracle resources for update requests from data feeds, randomness, or buffer
relayers. Oracle queue's act as an aggregator for on-chain consumers looking to
publish data on-chain by specifying an upfront reward a requester is required to
pay when a new update is requested by an oracle. Oracles act as an off-chain
compute resource that can be utilized by on-chain programs needing a
decentralized way to source data.
