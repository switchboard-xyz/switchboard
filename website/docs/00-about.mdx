# Switchboard

Welcome to the Switchboard Documentation. You'll find comprehensive product guides, 
various examples and API references to help you build inspiring projects with 
Switchboard's products.

## Introduction

In the traditional context of a switchboard, it is widely used in telecommunication 
infrastructures to manually establish connections to facilitate information flow 
between parties. Similarly, Switchboard, the oracle protocol, employs a decentralized 
quorum of oracles to shuffle data on a blockchain, empowering smart contract developers 
to build upon and utilize.

The latest iteration, Switchboard V3 is the next-gen oracle, introducing a new 
paradigm of how and what oracle infrastructures can provide to blockchain developers.

### What

Traditional oracles are limited to quantitative value reporting. Switchboard goes 
beyond, allowing for verifiable off-chain computes such as randomness, calculations 
and more.

Switchboard is a general purpose compute layer allowing you to build serverless
functions and delegate the off-chain compute and verification to our network of
oracles.

| Traditional Oracles                          | Switchboard                                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Limited to only quantitative value reporting | Ability to execute off-chain computes verifiably and submit transactions on-chain |
| Opaque source of information                 | Transparent function source code and logs readily available                       |
| Single method of data propagation            | Multiple methods such as push (cron schedule) and callback based                  |
| Huge upfront cost to list new price feed     | Pay as you go and permissionless creation of new data feed / function             |

### How

Switchboard provides verifiable computation with the use of Trusted Execution
Environments (TEEs). A TEE is a secure area within a device's hardware or
software that isolates sensitive data and code from the rest of the system.
Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a hardware-based technology that
provides TEE capabilities. Switchboard leverages SGX to run a user's custom code
within its own SGX runtime and provides the attestation service to verify
on-chain that the quote generated from the executed code matches the expected
measurement set by the user on-chain with their `MRENCLAVE` value.
