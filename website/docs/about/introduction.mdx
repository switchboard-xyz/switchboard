# Introduction

## Welcome to Switchboard's Documentation

Switchboard is a multichain, permissionless oracle protocol for general purpose data feeds  
and verifiable random function (VRF).

## Origin of Switchboard

Switchboard gets its name from the early days of phone networks, where operators would shuffle  
telephone lines around a 'switchboard' to complete a circuit and forward a dialer’s call to the  
next hop in the circuit.

Similarly, Switchboard, our oracle network is responsible for how external data gets updated  
and routed through a blockchain until it reaches its appropriate destination.

## What is an Oracle?

Blockchains do not have the capability of directly relaying information from off-chain to on-chain.  
Hence, enter oracles, a gateway between blockchain and real world data.

An oracle is not the data source, it is an infrastructure layer for querying, verifying  
and authenticating external data sources; which is relayed to the blockchain for a smart contract  
to read and carry out necessary course of action for its intended product.

## What makes Switchboard different?

Switchboard is permissionless. From a developer's perspective, you customize, build and manage  
your own data feeds where all of which can be done from Switchboard's [Publisher](https://app.switchboard.xyz).

> No friction, no contact, build permissionlessly.

## Use Cases

With the power of off-chain data being brought on-chain, Switchboard has plugged into mulitple verticals  
to build blockchain based applications today, such as:

- Determining the current price of an asset for collateralized lending
- Determining the state of a tracking number to auto settle funds on arrival
- Determining the current standings of the MLB for fantasy sports rankings
