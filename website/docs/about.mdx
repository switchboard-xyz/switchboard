Switchboard gets its name from the early days of phone networks, where operators
would shuffle telephone lines around a 'switchboard' to complete a circuit and
forward a dialer’s call to the next hop in the circuit. Similarly, Switchboard
the oracle protocol is responsible for how external data gets updated and routed
through a blockchain until it reaches its appropriate destination.

## What is an Oracle?

A blockchain is a deterministic, decentralized network of computers that compute
and store data in a shared ledger. Users interact with the chain via smart
contracts, which provide discrete instructions to modify the global ledger. The
quorom of validators, which enforces the security of the chain, needs to have
access to the same set of information so smart contracts are limited to only
consuming data currently stored on-chain. On-chain storage costs and bandwidth
limitations prevents us from relaying a large amount of data so we need a trust
minimized mechanism to efficiently route data on-chain without sacrificing
security.

Enter Oracles -- a trust minimized data pipeline which facilitates the flow of
information to on-chain smart contracts.

## Why do we need Oracles?

Let's start with the most basic principle of an oracle: an oracle makes data
available on a blockchain in order to execute some downstream ingestion of this
information. For example, Alice will transfer $100 to Bob if $BTC price >
$30,000 at the time of the transaction.

Simple concept! Not simple to build. In the world of trustlessness, the above
model hands off complete trust in execution to the operator of oracle `O`.

A single party trust model is unacceptable and reduces the trust model of the
application down to the trust in the oracle. Luckily, the next iteration of the
solution is not much more difficult to grasp.

Instead of having a single operator of oracle O, let's make this a multiparty
system:

By taking the median of multiple oracles, agreeing on a non-deterministic price,
such as the price of BTC, is as simple as taking the median of the reports.

But where is the incentive for these oracles? Can the oracle protocol prove to
the user applications that they arent reporting the same value sourced from a
single machine? Whats the incentive for these oracles to be honest if the
operators could make some form of profit by nefariously modifying their reports?
This is where oracle staking comes into play.

What if, on each report, oracle were mandated to put up stake S. On every
response, if they deviate more than .5% from the accepted result, their stake is
taken by the protocol and they could no longer report.

This is a great improvement! Now if the oracle stake is $1 million, you can have
confidence that all oracles have no incentive to collude if the downstream
application has less than $1 million of total volume.

But now, we have 2 persisting problems:

- Requiring each oracle to stake $1 million puts a high infrastructure cost for
  supporting an actual oracle and limits the scalability of delivering
  information on chain
- What if the TVL of the downstream applications are greater than the oracle
  allocated stake? Are they not still incentivized to collude?

These 2 problems continue to exist in all oracle protocols to date. And this is
exactly what Switchboard solves.
