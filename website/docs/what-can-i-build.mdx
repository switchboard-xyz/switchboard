# What Can I Build?

Some examples of what you can build with Switchboard include:

- **Lending Protocols** / **Decentralized Exchanges**: decentralized markets can
  be supported with a variety of Switchboard products
- **Sport Betting**: Any market which can be resolved from an API endpoint or
  maybe even an AI agent to scour the web for reliable sources
- **Random Number Generation**: Secure and unbiased random number generation for
  on-chain applications like lotteries or gaming.
- **Serverless Execution**: Triggering smart contracts based on specific
  off-chain conditions.
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Transparent governance and
  decision-making within decentralized organizations.
- **Escrow Services**: Creation of trustless, automated escrow systems.
- **Prediction Markets**: Forecasting future events using verifiable off-chain
  data and trusted execution environments.
- ... and more!

[Switchboard Functions](/functions) are completely configurable allowing you to
execute your own code off-chain in a verifiable manner which opens to door to
new use cases we as an ecosystem haven't considered yet.
