## Program

Switchboard V1 was the first oracle network deployed on Solana mainnet in
May 2021. The Oracle Program supports data feeds and verifiablle randomness
using a round-robin queue of off-chain oracles fulfilling update request. The
Attestation Program supports functions, secrets, and legacy data feeds using an
attestation service to verify that the execution of off-chain code was conducted
within a trusted execution environment (TEE).

You can find the program IDs for these deployments below, or check out
[The Network](/network) page to also view the Switchboard Labs supported oracle
networks.

## Getting Started

The [switchboard-xyz/solana-sdk](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/solana-sdk)
contains the Solana specific SDKs and examples for operating Switchboard.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/solana-sdk
```

## Functions

Switchboard Functions allow you to execute your own code off-chain in a
verifiable manner allowing you to build more dynamic programs. This allows you
to publish **_ANY_** data you want on a cron-based schedule, perform basic
maintenance operations, and execute async operations for your users! This lets
you have users interact with your program then perform async checks off-chain to
prevent data staleness and oracle extractable value attacks. Switchboard
Functions are flexible enough for any use case you can imagine without
sacrificing security.

- [Ex. 01: Basic Oracle Example](/solana/functions/examples/basic-oracle-example)
- [Ex. 02: Randomness Callback](/solana/functions/examples/randomness-callback)

## Data Feeds

Switchboard Data Feeds allow you to permissionless publish a data point on-chain
for use with your smart contracts. These values are published at a periodic
interval such that your users do not need to wait for any off-chain execution in
order to consume the values.

- [Ex. 01: Read Data Feed On-Chain](/solana/feeds/examples/read-data-feed)

## Verifiable Random Function

Switchboard's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) on Solana allows you to request
randomness and execute a subsequent user defined callback on fulfillment. This
ensures your users are always consuming a newly provided randomness value,
preventing a malicous user from waiting for a favorable value and gaming your
smart contract.

This is very computationally intensive and requires 48 transactions to verify
on-chain. Users should instead use the
[Randomness Callback Function](/solana/functions/examples/randomness-callback)
to generate randomness in a single transaction at <span>1 / 20</span> of the
cost!

  [demo app](https://vrf-demo.switchboard.xyz/) that simulates a heads-or-tails
  coin toss.
