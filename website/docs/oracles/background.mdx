# Background

A Switchboard oracle is a Node.js container that sits between a blockchain and
the internet and waits for update requests from an oracle queue. An oracle queue
assigns updates to oracles in a round robin fashion.

Switchboard oracles on all supported chains **MUST** have a mainnet Solana RPC
in order to run the task runner. This is used to support legacy task types for
fetching on-chain Solana data.

An oracle belongs to a specific oracle queue and must be granted permissions
from the queue authority before heartbeating to signal readiness on-chain. An
oracle must also maintain the minimum stake amount, set by the queue, or it will
be booted from the queue.

An oracle account is a program derived address (PDA) between the oracle queue
it’s being initialized for, as well as the oracles staking wallet. Before an
oracle is granted permissions to use a queue, it must transfer the minimum stake
amount, set by the queue, to its staking wallet.

## Latest Oracle Version

You can find the docker image on dockerhub under
[switchboardlabs/node](https://hub.docker.com/r/switchboardlabs/node).

The current latest oracle version is:

`dev-v2-09-13-22`

[DockerHub - dev-v2-09-13-22](https://hub.docker.com/layers/switchboardlabs/node/dev-v2-09-13-22/images/sha256-046d5e40fd2e7a508e17b37e5c632f96b1ed0750241a9d2598c8d2d3d554a05b?context=explore)

## Staking

An oracle is required to transfer `queue.minStake` tokens to its staking wallet,
`oracle.tokenAccount`, before being granted queue permissions. The minStake acts
as an insurance policy to entice honest oracle behavior.

## Heartbeat

An oracle is required to heartbeat on-chain in order to join the queue and be
assigned update request. An oracle must heartbeat before the queue's specified
`queue.oracleTimeout` or it will be removed from the queue by the queue's
garbage collector.

## Metrics

The oracle also tracks its performance, `oracle.metrics`.

## Cost & Reward Estimations

An oracle is required to submit an SaveResult transaction each time it updates a
feed, which incurs a cost of 5000 lamports. This fee is set by the Solana
network and is subject to change.

$T_{perUpdate}=T_{queueReward} - T_{transactionCost}$

where,

- `T` is the raw token amount in base units (_Ex: lamports, tGas, or satoshis_)

To estimate an oracles cost basis, you will need to know a queue's capacity
(Oracles, Feeds, VRFs) and the average number of update request an oracle is
assigned over a given time period.

You will also need to factor in the oracle's heartbeat cost, which is 5000
lamports each. The number of heartbeats is dependent on its
`queue.oracleTimeout`, which determines how often an oracle is required to
heartbeat.

## Hardware Requirements

A Switchboard oracle should be hosted in a highly available environment with
some level of redundancy and fail over to prevent outages, although oracles are
not deducted for being offline.

At the very minimum a node should have:

- 4gb RAM
- 3.0 Ghz CPU
- 100+ Mbps connection
