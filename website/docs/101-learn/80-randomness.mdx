While true-randomness on some computers can be made possible via atmospheric
noise and special hardware modules, such solutions on blockchains are not
possible since they are virtual machines without physical hardware. Thus,
pseudorandom-functions are needed to close this gap. **_You should be skeptical
of teams claiming they offer true randomness._**

Random numbers are crucial for many DeFi applications whether its fair NFT
launches, gambling, gaming, or assigning user roles in a DAO. Without an element
of randomness, each of the above could be exploited and the final outcome
predicted.

Switchboard has had a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) deployed on Solana since
February 2022. While this is not going away, it should be replaced in favor of
using a [Switchboard Function](/functions) to generate randomness within a TEE
and perform the callback into the users program. The Solana VRF implementation
required 40+ transactions in order to perform the necessary computations while a
Switchboard Function will take only a single transaction to settle resulting in
a better user experience.

A [**Switchboard Function**](/functions) can be used to generate randomness
within a secure enclave.
