# The Data Models

The following sections depict the different ways developers can integrate
Switchboard to have full control over how data is sourced on-chain for their
smart contracts.

## Push

Data is _**pushed**_ on-chain by the oracle at a routine interval. The
integrator just needs to verify the data was recently pushed and doesn't need to
handle any off-chain requesting.

See [Data Feeds](/data-feeds) for more information.

## Pull (Coming Soon)

Data is maintained in a data store and _**pulled**_ on-chain by the integrator.

  }}

## Callback

Data is sourced off-chain each time it is requested and populated on-chain with
a callback into the callers smart contract. This method is more complex to
integrate but is less susceptible to oracle attacks because the data is only
sourced when the user requests it.

See [Switchboard Functions](/functions) for more information.
