  "Learn about Switchboard Functions and how they can be used to write custom
  off-chain logic for your smart contracts"

## Work in Progress

## Overview

Switchboard Functions allow you to verifiably execute your own Rust code
off-chain and submit transactions either on a pre-defined cron schedule or
on-demand. Switchboard Functions gives smart contracts greater flexibility as
they can delegate execution to an off-chain computational layer.

Switchboard Functions are executed within its own Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE) which provides verification that the code being executed matches the
expected **_measurement_** (MrEnclave) authorized by the function's owner.

### Scheduled

Functions can set a cron schedule to have it executed periodically. This is
useful for automating tasks on-chain with custom conditional logic. You could
use the scheduled functions to settle a perpetual 24 hour lottery. Or you could
use a scheduled function to perform account maintenance and cleanup.

### On-Demand

Functions can also be executed on-demand with custom parameters. This provides
more "user-level" customizability allowing your smart contract to execute user
centric actions off-chain. For example, if you are operating an on-chain
exchange you are only as fast as your oracle can update which can have a number
of bottlenecks depending on the chain architecture; so you're always striking a
balance between oracle cost and oracle staleness while trying to manage a decent
web3 UX. With Switchboard Functions you can off-load order settlement to a
Switchboard Function which fetches the oracle price before settling the users
order. This mitigates a large majority of oracle attack vectors allowing a
trader to profit off of stale prices.

On Solana, on-demand functions use the `FunctionRequestAccount` to store the
custom params and points to the parent `FunctionAccount`. This allows you to
manage user params and management in isolated accounts.
