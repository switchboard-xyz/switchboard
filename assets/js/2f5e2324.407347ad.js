To account for\nthis we can set the varianceThreshold to 0.1%, which instructs the oracles to\nskip reporting a value if the value hasn\u2019t differed by 0.1% since the last\nreported value on-chain. This will greatly extend the life of your feed but\nmakes it hard to estimate the length of time left on the feed since it will\ndepend on the feeds volatility and market conditions. Our feed will now only\nincur a cost when a feeds value has changed significantly."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Great, we\u2019ve found some ways to reduce cost without sacrificing security. But\nwhat if the XYZ asset suffers some loss of interest and reduce volatility? Your\nfeed may fail to update for hours on end if the price hasn\u2019t moved by the set\nvarianceThreshold. This can be mitigated by setting a forceReportPeriod, which\ninstructs the oracles to always report a result on-chain even if the variance\nthreshold wasn\u2019t exceeded, or max staleness. We will set forceReportPeriod to\n900 so the feed will always report a value on-chain every 15minutes. When\nintegrating on-chain, we should always be checking if the feed was updated\nwithin the forceReportPeriod interval to ensure the feed is healthy."))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
